            <h2>What is First In First Out Page Replacement?</h2>   
            <hr/>
            <p>FIFO which is also known as First In First Out is one of the types of page replacement algorithm. The FIFO algorithm is used in the paging method for memory management in an operating system that decides which existing page needs to be replaced in the queue. FIFO algorithm replaces the oldest (First) page which has been present for the longest time in the main memory.</p> 
            <p>In simple words, When a new page comes in from secondary memory to main memory, It selects the front of the queue which is the oldest page present, and removes it.</p>

            <h2>How does FIFO Page Replacement work?</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>In summary, the FIFO algorithm works like a line or queue, where the first process in is the first one out. The OS uses a queue data structure to keep track of the order of the processes waiting to use a resource and uses enqueue and dequeue operations to add and remove processes from the queue.			</p>
            <p>Overall, using the FIFO algorithm makes it easy for the computer to decide which program gets to use the resource it needs. It's a fair way of doing things that's easy to understand and predict.
