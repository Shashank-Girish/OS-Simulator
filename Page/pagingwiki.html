            <h2>What is Paging?</h2>   
            <hr/>
            <p>Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. The process of retrieving processes in the form of pages from the secondary storage into the main memory is known as paging. The basic purpose of paging is to separate each procedure into pages. Additionally, frames will be used to split the main memory.This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non-contiguous.</p> 
            <p>In a paging scheme, the physical cope with area is divided into fixed-length frames, each of which contains some of bytes or words. When a process is running, its logical address space is split into constant-size pages, which might be mapped to corresponding frames within the physical address space.</p>
            <p>The mapping between logical pages and physical page frames is maintained by the page table, which is used by the memory management unit to translate logical addresses into physical addresses. The page table maps each logical page number to a physical page frame number.</p>
