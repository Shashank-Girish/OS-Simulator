            <h2>What is Optimal Page Replacement?</h2>   
            <hr/>
           <p>Optimal page replacement algorithm is the most desirable page replacement algorithm that we use for replacing pages. This algorithm replaces the page whose demand in the future is least as compared to other pages from frames (secondary memory). The replacement occurs when the page fault appears. The purpose of this algorithm is to minimize the number of page faults

            <h2>How does Optimal Page Replacement work?</h2>
            <hr/>
<p>The page replacement algorithm aims to reduce page faults as much as possible. To do this, this algorithm searches for the page from reference, which is not going to be used earliest, and considers this page useless for that instant of time. And that page is replaced by the new page in the frame.</p>     <p>In other words, any page that has been inactive for an extended period of time is more likely to remain inactive. As a result, it is preferable to replace that page.</p>
<p>The optimal page replacement algorithm is not practical because it cannot predict whether the page it is going to remove will not be used in the future</p>
