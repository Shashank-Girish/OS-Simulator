            <h2>What is Least Recently Used Page Replacement?</h2>   
            <hr/>
            <p>LRU stands for Least Recently Used. As the name suggests, it is based on the concept that if any page fault occurs, it replaces the least recently used page with the newly desired one. </p> 
            <p>It is a Greedy algorithm where the page to be replaced is least recently used. The idea is based on locality of reference. Therefore, pages that were accessed recently are more likely to be accessed again in the near future than pages that were accessed a long time ago.</p>

            <h2>How does LRU Page Replacement work?</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>When a new page needs to be loaded into memory, and there is no free space, the algorithm scans the list from the beginning and replaces the page that was accessed least recently.</p>            
            <p>In other words, any page that has been inactive for an extended period of time is more likely to remain inactive. As a result, it is preferable to replace that page.</p>
